This repository contains practical examples and projects showcasing key C++ concepts with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It covers:

Classes and Objects: Demonstrates how to create and use classes with constructors and destructors.
Encapsulation: Using access specifiers to control data visibility (public, private, protected).
Inheritance: Shows examples of single and multiple inheritance.
Polymorphism: Illustrates method overloading and virtual functions for dynamic behavior.
Abstraction: Implements abstract classes and interfaces.
File Handling: Examples of reading and writing files using C++ file streams.
Exception Handling: Handling errors with try-catch blocks.
STL: Using containers like vectors and lists for data management.
